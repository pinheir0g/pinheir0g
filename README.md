>>>>>>> 53e2844c38fdfa170384ce6eec3e8e75d0aab904

I started to learn about programming 4 months ago.
In this time I started my studies with Python, took a free course and then got to know other areas of programming.

Today, I have basic knowledge of Python, SQL, html-css, Linux, Git and GitHub now.
My goal is to become a BackEnd-Developer, I study about 8h a day to achieve this goal as soon as possible
