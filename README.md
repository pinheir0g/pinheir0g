## Curiosities about me

- I'am currently working as a salesman in a company that sells natural products;
- I studied and worked in the brazilian financial market for 3 years;
- After I started working as a salesman, I got discouraged from the financial market, because I had worked for a long time without many results, so after 1 year in my new job, tired of working with sales, I decided to work as a developer and start studying programming and understand more of this universe.
